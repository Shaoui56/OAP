# Output Alignment Protocol (OAP)

**The Output Alignment Protocol (OAP) â€“ A Practical Guide for Safer LLM Outputs**

---

## ðŸ“„ About
The Output Alignment Protocol (OAP) is an **open framework** designed to ensure that Large Language Model (LLM) outputs remain **secure, ethical, and aligned** with user intent.  

This repository hosts the guide, resources, and discussion space for implementing OAP in AI pipelines.  

---

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s in the Guide
- A human-readable overview of OAP principles  
- Practical steps for integrating alignment checks into LLM workflows  
- Techniques to detect & mitigate risks (prompt injection, RAG vulnerabilities, etc.)  
- Benefits for enterprises, researchers, and developers adopting responsible AI
